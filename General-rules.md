# General notes :construction:
- Make sure that you take enough time for the planning phase, draw the initial screens (wireframes)
- Agree on the Style guide ( Branding -> Colors, fonts, and pictures).
- Keep it consistent:
If you get to set the rules for the project or are working alone, then the most important thing to do is to keep things consistent. Consistency can be applied in all sorts of ways, such as using the same naming conventions for classes, choosing one method of describing color, or maintaining consistent formatting (for example will you use tabs or spaces to indent your code? If spaces, how many spaces?)

>- Having a set of rules you always follow reduces the amount of mental overhead needed when writing CSS, as some of the decisions are already made.
Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Organizing 
 - Use a consistent layout for the whole project.
 
- Agree on the File structure. 

 - Naming Branches
 
*follow this style*

Action/Name of section
Example : update/header-section
number of issue-Action-name of section 
Example : 12-create-header-section 

- When the team reviews the pull-request :
1. Read and test the code, pull it to your local machine
2. if you have any comments and there is sth you want it to change write it and change the label to `change-request
3. When you get the approval from the team leader and one of the members, the label will change to `approved` and you can merge your pull-request.
4. Delete the branch 
5. In the issue change the label to `Done`
6. Close the issue 
> DONE
---
## Steps you should follow when you will start working on an issue and create a pull request :

- Assign yourself in the issue you will work on it and add the label `in-progress`
- Create a new branch and be sure that it's **up to date with the main branch**
- Time Estimation
try and include a time estimating for every issue, even if you are not sure.
_There are 5 built-in time labels:_
> - T1d: 1 day
> - T1h: 1 hour
> - T2h: 2 hours
> - T4h: 4 hours (half-day)
> - T25m: 25min

 When completing issues please leave a comment with the time actually taken to complete the issue.
